# Git Commands üèóÔ∏è
In order to check if we allready have git on our system type:
```
git --version
```
To initialize a repository into a folder that we are going to use as repository
```
git init
```
Create a new file in the repository
```
touch [filename.extension]
```
Show the file contents
```
cat [filename.extension]
```
Show the status of our repository
```
git status
```
Add to the git index (Staging area) all the file or some of them
```
git add . or git add [filename.extension] or git add [*.extension]
```
To commit the changes use:
```
git commit -m "[commit message]" -m "[commit description]"
```
In order to avoid to use `git add` before the commit we can do something like:
```
git commit -am "[commit message]"
```
where the -a parameter stand for 'all'

<hr>

Remove file from the index (Staging area)
```
git restore --staged [filename.extension]
```
When we want to see the history of the commits
```
git log
```
See the references of the HEAD file
```
cat .git/HEAD
```
See the commits list in a short way
```
git log --oneline
```
Restore te previus commit instead of the new one by sending a new commit
```
git revert
```
To change the message of the last commit
```
git commit --amend -m "message"
```
To undo the commit
```
git reset or git reset --soft or git reset --hard
```
- _--mixed_ &rarr; this remove the commit and the file in the staging area (default version) 
  - ***[TL:DR: Remove the commit and the stage area]***
- _--soft_ &rarr; this remove commit and restore the file status to the staging area 
  - ***[TL:DR: Remove the commit]***
- _--hard_ &rarr; this remove the commit and all the added files in the last commit, this will remove the file physically 
  - ***[TL:DR: Remove the commit, the stage area and delete the files!]***

***NOTICE:*** we can use `git reset --[parameter]` with the id of the commit or the `HEAD` and the position of the commit that we want to refer to, like so: `git reset --[parameter] HEAD~1` in case we need 1 position before the `HEAD` pointer, or `git reset --[parameter] HEAD~2` in case we need to go back of 2 commits before the `HEAD`.

<hr />

- In order to remove file from the `git add .` we need to set a `.gitignore` file which will contains all the file, extensione and folder that we need to avoid to commit, also we can apply a rule to allow a single file of a specified denied extension.

<hr />

### Branch ü¶∫
The common way to use a branch is to keep the stable version of the software as a main branch, and all the other features that are experimental or that can comport some bug fixing or even make the software to be unstable, are destinated to be stored in some side branch.

The `master` name is made by initialize the folder to our repository.

The branch in the beginning is a simple label that identifies the last commit of that specific branch.

In order to see a graphical rapresentation of our branches configuration we can use such a command
```
git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
```
Also we can create an Alias to avoid to type everytime all that.
I've made a little bit different commands to do the same thing, just a bit more clear.
Also i've placed those two commands as alias

```PowerShell
hist = log --pretty=format:\"%Cgreen%h %Creset%cd %Cblue[%cn] %Creset%s%C(yellow)%d%C(reset)\" --graph --date=relative --decorate --all
llog = log --graph --name-status --pretty=format:\"%C(red)%h %C(reset)(%cd) %C(green)%an %Creset%s %C(yellow)%d%Creset\" --date=relative
```

To create a branch we use:
```
git branch [name]
```
In order to see all branches we type just `git branch` with no arguments.
Every new branch that is created will point to the last commit, so where the `HEAD` is.

In order to move in between branches we need to move the `HEAD`, and to do that we can use:
```
git checkout [branch name]
```

After that we've made some changes to the files in every branches, we may want to merge them back into the main branch.
To do that we need to use 
```
git merge
```

Before to do that we can check the difference between the two branches by using
```
git diff [first branch]..[second branch]
```

In order to merge those branch one in an other we need to:
```
git checkout [first branch]
git merge [second branch]
```
The merge can be make in a different way:
- **_FastForward_** by moving ahead the branch `master` to match the last commit of the `fix` branch.
- ***Three Way Merge***In case you move the `HEAD` in a commit that is not a direct parent of the branch that we want to merge, git, will verify the commit that is shared in between branches and compare it to the next commit in order to check if there will be some issue.

In order to see which branch was merged we can use
```
git branch --merged
```
If we don't need anymore a specific branch we can remove it by using:
```
git branch -d [branch name]
```
***NOTICE:*** that if the branch was not already merged we can force the delete with uppercase `-D` parameter

In case we want to undo some merge we can use
```
git merge --abort
```

If we wont to move and in the same time create a branch we can use
```
git checkout -b [new branch name]
```
<hr/>

### Use Remote server as repository store GitHub

Once that we made a GitHub account we can set the origin address with:
```
git remote add origin [address]
```
To upload our local repository to the server provided by GitHub we need to type:
```
git push -u origin master
```

### Commands that need to be inserted into the list
Command that allows the user to use VSCode as editor for the commit message 
```
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

Show if the Local Ref. is up to date by comparing the Local branch and the Remote branch.
```
git remote show origin
```
